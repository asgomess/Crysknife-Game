## 🧩 Overview

This repository contains the source code, assets, and documentation for our Java-based game project.  
The game is being developed using **object-oriented programming principles** and designed for **cross-platform compatibility**.

**Gameplay Highlights:**
- Player controls a **sword** to eliminate **worms**.  
- Worms move **randomly** and disappear once defeated.  
- **Score and time tracking** determine progression.  
- Sequential levels increase difficulty by **adding more worms** and/or faster movements.  
- Game screens include: **Welcome**, **Next Level**, **Game Over**, and **Final Game**.  

**Challenges & Learning Goals:**
- Loading and managing **images** for player, enemies, and backgrounds.  
- Implementing **sound effects** for actions and events.  
- Designing clear **gameplay rules** and level progression.  
- Creating and integrating all **graphical assets**.  
- Developing a **schematic of the gameplay** with pseudocode.
